# FrontalLobe

A library to create and train Artificial Nueral Network classifier and analyse their performance.

Currently, it only includes a class to implement Artificial Nueral Networks and a confusion matrix class for its analysis 
and validation named 'NueralNetwork' and 'confusionMatrix' respectively. It also include three other suppport classes namely
'NueronLayer', 'rolledVector' and its subclass 'skeletonRolledVector' for smooth and fast working of the 'NueralNetwork' class.

This is library also contains a special feature of real
time display of change in activation values of the component nuerons in the Nueral Network object while training, so that the user can understand the source of any numerical errors and also because it looks cool!
